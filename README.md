 @author _Five philosophers are sitting at a table and
think. After such a great effort they become
hungry. To eat, each philosopher needs knife
and fork. Between each two philosophers are
either a knife or a fork, so that each
philosopher have access only to those
adjacent to him. After each use, the knife and
the fork should be cleaned.
